# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built using JavaScript and React. It allows you to visualize the process of sorting using the merge sort algorithm. Additionally, it provides a shuffle button to randomly shuffle the array and a sort button to initiate the merge sort visualization.



## Features

- Visualize the merge sort algorithm step-by-step.
- Shuffle button to randomize the array.
- Sort button to initiate the merge sort visualization.
- Clean and intuitive user interface.
